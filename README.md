# Passowrd Generator

This is a password generator I made using JavaScript. This has easily been one of the more difficult things I have done so far, but overall it was a great learning experience. Using a mixture of arrays, variables, loops, and true/false statements I was able to create something to be proud of. 


## Include JavaScript Link in the HTML

1. Put JavaScript file into the Develop folder.
2. Update the script tag in the HTML file.

## Create the Functional Password Generator

1. Use JavaScript to create a working password generator
2. The password will start to generate once the Generate Password button is clicked.
3. Users will be prompted with a various alerts to confirm if they would like lower case letters, upper case letters, special characters, and/or numbers.
4. Once the user has made those selections a unique password with their cirteria will be genertated.
